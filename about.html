         <h2>Introduction</h2>

         <p>
         A little bit of history. Manuals have always included images, parts diagrams, and references to other documents. Those links and metadata are a significant part of what makes a manual effective. The internet is perfect for making these documents come alive, making it possible to connect procedures with tools and reference specifications.
         Unfortunately, the vast majority of manuals distributed online don't take advantage of this flexibility. PDF documents are static, have no structure to their data.
         </p>
         
         <p>
         A huge amount of useful data is buried, trapped in static documents where it cannot be leveraged, built upon, and repurposed.
	 </p>

	 <p>
         oManual is an XML-based data standard that solves this problem. Publishing manuals as both user-friendly PDF / HTML and machine-friendly oManual files allows for the best of both worlds: manuals that retain their ease of use, but are also easy to maintain and build upon.
         </p>
         
	 <h2>How did oManual get started?</h2>
         <p>
         oManual started when <a href="http://oreilly.com">O'Reilly Media</a> (a leading publisher of technical books) and <a href="http://www.ifixit.com">iFixit</a>  (the free online repair manual) started searching for a data format to archive their procedural manuals. Existing XML specifications were overly broad and convoluted, ill-suited for procedural manuals. So we created a specialized format to fill the gap.
         </p>

         <h2>Who is it for?</h2>

         <p>
         Open Manual is for anyone who wants to publish manuals, whether they
         are repair manuals, manuals to create things, manuals to destroy things, technique manuals or any other type of manual which contains step by step instructions. Open Manual is also for developers who want a flexible format that allows them to republish content in new and exciting
         ways. 
         </p>

	 <h2>What exactly is a manual?</h2>
	 <p>Manual is an &#8220;overloaded&#8221; word, and most dictionaries have outdated definitions referring to instruction books. Here's our definition: A manual is a document that shows you how to do something. To pick a few examples, we think oManual is a good fit for reference manuals, instruction manuals, user manuals, owner's manuals, how-to manuals, survival guides, and service manuals&mdash;but that's just a start.</p>
	 
         
         <h2>Can I help?</h2>

         <p>
         Absolutely. We will be expanding the standard as needed. Our driving principles:
         </p>
         <ol>
            <li>The format should be as simple as possible, and no simpler.</li>
            <li>No manual stands alone. oManual should enable prerequisite chaining and semantic linking, referencing external documents as much as possible.</li>
            <li>Manuals are not simply text. They are dynamic documents that encapsulate images, videos, and other technical details.</li>
          </ol>
         <p>
