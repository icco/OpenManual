         <h2>Introduction</h2>

         <p>
         A little bit of history. OpenManual started when iFixit.com realized
         that they wanted to share their repair manuals with the world forever,
         even if the company didn't last as long.  To do this iFixit started
         working with the internet archive and O'Reilly to create a format to
         save the combined repair knowledge of man kind forever.
